This purchasing data analysis and forecast understand the selected one buyer’s supply cost in total price, monthly supply consumption, and forecast the next 12 months’ supply consumption demand.
 
Part 1:  By connecting the extracted CSV file for data exploration to clean the unnecessary data to prepare the desired data analysis.
Calculate each supply unit price by using a division formula.
Part 2: The analysis determines how many supplies are consumed within a month. 
Calculate the total monthly supply quantity based on sales consumption. Understanding the trends in purchasing behavior for different buyers and items.
Part 3: Prediction can forecast future supply needs using time series analysis. 
By using an ARIMA model to the monthly supply data to capture the trend and seasonality. Using the fitted model to forecast future supply quantities for the next 12 months.
 
This is only an example to showcase my coding skills in Python. Depending on the job tasks, I will use the relevant library functions for in-depth data analysis.
Thank you for your review and comments for further development.
